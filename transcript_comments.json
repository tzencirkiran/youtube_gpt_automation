            "transcript": "yes or no so that we can continue i think there's a problem with the internet connection so yeah my voice is clear right hello hi hi everyone i am akash okay i think there was a problem with the internet connection so uh streaming stopped at the same time so yeah so i needed i needed to create a new link okay okay it's fine my walls is clear now okay i think can you wait for just five five more minutes so that everyone can join i think that link has been changed so that's a problem although uh i have shared my new link uh in the in that post the landing post so if you all could just uh re repaste it over there so that everyone can just know it that there was a problem and we have created a new link okay yeah now my voice is clear finally so yes sometime this happens and i know this is my first stream so maybe uh the problem is that this this kind of problem can occur so we'll we'll take few few questions from linkedin uh many of them has has posted uh many questions regarding uh how to approach data science like how to start with it and what are the things we can do with respect to that and so uh i have gathered many questions from many many other people who are just being to me and even i will take the question from live chat as well so let me discuss few of the questions as well so we can start in this two moments two to three moments yes till then i will find few questions yeah right for you all yeah i will discuss about uh those courses as well like uh whether you should go for a pgdm course or any kind of a post graduation uh certification course in in data science so i will discuss such kind of things also in this so there are there are questions regarding these as well like you should go for these courses or not uh yeah i will discuss about that also like how it is helpful how it was helpful for me yeah i will share although all the uh resources that how you can progress in a manner like in data science okay okay [Music] actually yeah so so there are many questions right so let's start what do you say yeah i have done postgraduation diploma and designs it will be damn frugal okay apart from this pgp courses please let us know the strategy for the learning data science as well how can we prepare myself here how much people per day time we should okay yeah sure i will i will i will definitely gonna speak about these topics as well so first let me uh tell you something like what i have prepared then we can take your topics as well so i think um you will get all your uh doubts clear over here when when i will proceed with my questions what i have prepared right now so uh with respect to that i think uh your many dollars will be cleared so i have got many questions from uh linkedin and uh these questions are from rafiq uh right so he is asking like what are the what are what all complete resources you followed for start of the journey to the end so he's asking about the resources what what i have taken in this journey of learning data science so so uh i have taken yeah you can all even take a pen and paper you have even write it over on something or you can take a note of it so that you can also refer in that manner uh how you should learn and where what are the resources you should do i mean to take so i am going to list some kind some resources so that you can refer directly to it and you can just learn in an easy way and that's that that is free so uh first of all learning uh let's start with the python right so you must be finding that which is the genuine resource to learn python so for python i would suggest you to go for free sources i'm just stopping all the free resources no nothing i wouldn't talk about any paid resources so you can go on youtube and search corey shaffer so over there in his in his channel you can learn python for free and in python you you can learn pandas numpy over there from from there uh kodi shafter youtube resources so yes uh the python the pandas numpy and the a few relation to like uh matplotlib uh sebon and other kind of uh uh videos you can you can find over there as well now moving to statistics so uh after python you should uh always have a uh you should always have good understanding of statistics as well so that you can progress and understand the data as well so for statistics you can uh prefer khan academy videos uh it is available on youtube so you can generally go and learn a few basics of status and you can start with it uh yeah the the name of that uh channel is kodi chef i will i will i will write it over here yeah i'll write it right in the chat kodi okay you can refer to that yeah so and for status 6 you can go for khan academy it is available on the youtube as well next for uh after that and you should also help me like even even i can forget the scenario and like the scene so you can if i forget anything you can just tell me that you you are left with such things also topic also so i can provide you the resources and so for machine learning you can prefer uh android ng courses uh those are best courses available in like uh in the youtube channel and everywhere like everyone is preferring that so you can go and check those resources as well so for machine learning you should go from android g for python instead of for python you should go for corey shaffer or you can also go for coursera courses course right so there you can find uh python for data science as well i like ibm courses and there are many few courses uh many courses are there over there in course there are many good courses so you can go and prefer those as well so so so for python for free sources you can go for youtube and for learning uh on coursera you can also go for course also for python and the next thing is for statistics for status is the free resource and the very good resources khan academy sources so you can go and learn the basics of statistics and they will in that the person who is teaching over there he will help you from the scratch so go and learn statistics from there then you can go for the implementation of the statistics on your data sets so after that after these things done the python and statistics are done then you can go and read and go and read about the machine learning part so now after going through these topics you can go and learn status machine learning so much for machine learning you should go uh we should always prefer android because he's the master of this machine learning and all these data science uh rules uh are made by him only so yes already i always follow him so please uh go and check his youtube channel as well andrew ng so you can find uh machine learning courses by him and they are very in very detailed so you can go and just just just go and and in a flow you will understand everything you don't have to just uh you don't have to go and prefer other resources as well so you can just go and do it do those courses and you will just uh get over it you can just type the name like uh machine learning on youtube you can like write machine learning by android g you will get you will get the resources and you can you can get the uh videos as well so for machine learning you're done and if you want to prefer some few topics like um you know krishnak channel so you can prefer that as well for learning basic things of machine learning and many many many things you can also learn over there in the krishna channel so yeah you can add the channel also as well so and please prepare notes while while uh viewing those kind of videos because for the first time you should always prepare the notes and so that you can trigger device you know in a certain way like in a in a week you should revise it like i i always prefer strategy to uh to revise such kind of topics such kind of complex topics like i prefer a four uh ones i i prefer such kind of things like four ones means the first first one means like today i am learning so second second one means tomorrow i will again revise the thing which i have learned yesterday and third one is i will revise uh the things which i have learned on this day in the next week and and and the fourth one is i will revise the thing after one month so after this after following the strategy you will be able to revive recall the things uh whatever you have learned right so the thing is these things are very very mathematical and you have to retain yourself for the uh for for longer time so that you can crack the interview as well so i follow this kind of strategy to revise like today which i have told like for one uh strategy and you can prefer that as well so you can you can follow this strategy to recall the things and uh and you should always prepare a note so that you can you can prepare you can you shouldn't go and prefer the video always because it will take again uh that much amount of time so you don't want to spend such such amount of such amount of time uh again and again so yes uh i i always suggest you to make a notes of each and every thing what you're learning now so python i have uh preferred a youtube channel kodi again i will revise it kodi then status is khan academy then android courses and plus uh krishna's video videos or youtube channels and the next day you can go for uh like few of the nlp tasks as well because you have learned a machine learning so then you can go for nlp uh with machine learning or with deep learning and not become a different right now so for nlp you can prefer akishnak's uh playlist of on llp you will get a basic idea about it like how the machine learning is working in the terms of nlp and what are the things you can work in the in the nlp part so yes for uh nlp after much learning machine learning nlp is just a application of machine learning so nlp is nothing but uh the human language you are doing it is called natural language processing so whatever you are saying you just have to take those inputs and you have to prepare a machinery model over it so yes so for that you can prefer uh channel for nlp and your all your uh you are noting right on your on your pen and paper or any kind of stuff right please note down these things and prepare and start learning data science from tomorrow itself so tomorrow monday better day to start so nlp you can prefer nlp for like a krishna channel for nlp and i'm just talking about the uh basic parts of uh foundations on on nlp and machine learning so after learning these three these these three topics uh mainly python uh pandas numpy and this is my matplotlib c-bond this all things you will find in corey shepherd's youtube channel right the next thing is statistics you should always go for strategy with the khan academy you will get the basic understanding of it then machine learning uh from entrance course that is a full course you can get it over course and also you can apply for financial aid in the course right you will get a a few questions over there or applying the financial aid and you can get that course free for free you can learn free for free that those courses can be learned by you in a free manner so you have to just apply a financial aid in the coursera site for that particular uh course and you can do it for free also so and you will get a certification as well from from course era and it is recognized well so even i am doing right now uh many many uh many uh specializations from foster so it is it is very good resource you can do it so yeah uh so following this path uh you so you have to do these things like in a frame of like two to three months right so in those in those three months you should do this these things you should build a foundation then side by side you should you're learning that that doesn't mean you're you're always watching the video and you shouldn't be like uh you should you should always learn and just forget about the things you should learn and practice as well so when you complete a python uh and when you complete your uh matplotlib c bond pandas and numpy start using your data sets right and side by side you should start preparing the status x when you when you have done these three uh python pandas and number start doing uh those kind of uh functions and what you have learned uh over there and start learning statistics side by side so that you can understand that what you are doing in the data set right so such kind of things you can do and you should be always multitasking right because the the competition is very high uh so we will discuss about deep learning architecture let's first first complete the machining task yeah so so this is how you should follow and next next thing what what you're gonna do is uh after learning statistics and python parallely uh then you can go for machine learning so you should be thorough with this do these three things like python numpy pandas and statistics you should be very very thorough to move to machine learning because in machine learning you should always know the mathematics so their mathematics will always be there so in order to understand the mathematics you should be uh well thorough with the statistics part so statistics means a statistic probability because at the end everything will come come to the probability itself so you should be knowing about the probability so these all concepts should be uh in a uh should be framed in such a manner that you're not forwarding anything so now you can learn machine learning after after learning machine learning uh you should always like in while learning machine learning you should always uh think one thing you should always remember one thing right that you should always consider a mathematic part because in each and every interview they're gonna ask you mathematics because implementation of machine learning is very easy the everything everything has been provided in the sql library so you don't have to worry about such implementation you can always google it for for sure for learning for implementation of machine but mathematics is important and why i'm forcing you to learn mathematics because you you never know how the data is because the data is behaving in every different manner like it is it is different for different person so uh the mathematics for each and every data will be different so you should always know that in which kind of data i can apply such kind of algorithm so you can only get to know that which kind of algorithm i can implement on this data is only when when you know the mathematics of that that algorithm so that's why i'm for for focusing on this mathematics parts so you should always go and prefer mathematics first in in machine learning and learn those concepts very well because these mathematics these mathematic parts will help you in deep learning as well so you should always learn mathematics and don't be scared that it is going tough because because it is not tough it is very easy once you understand i know in the first time you will you will face some difficulties but it's fine uh if you revise for like two or three times you will get enough of knowledge and you will understand the concept as well so the thing is when you approach for the first time for any kind of new technology it will be tough but as soon as you start revising those things it will be very it will become very easy for you so this is these are the this is the things what i am talking about the main emphasis is like you should always focus on mathematics and this the rest of the things implementation is done uh you can see on the google itself now current part now now after uh like the people can take the time like at three to four months to complete this this scenario like for machine learning yes you can do it there's no problem you can always take your time and whatever the pace you have you can do it if you're working you should always uh take it you take your time according to that and if you're a student you can take your time uh like in in a span of three to four months you can compete if your student and for working i guess it would take around five to six months to complete your machine learning task so yes you can do it and there's no uh foundation in learning any kind of things and the next thing after learning your machine learning you should always go for the competitions so that what you have learned you should always apply in the competition so you can you can prefer kaggle.com for for completing until then i think in the in the span of six months or three months depending on your scenario where you're working or not so you can uh you you must be preparing some kind of you must be using some kind of data in that in that month in those months in those times so you should always uh learn and implement learn and implement in those six months or three to four months then after completing machine learning and every kind of topics in those data science uh in the start of the data science then you can go and attend the competitions so competitions are necessary because you're gonna get the new data sets over there and you will you're learning something over there so you can prefer uh new uh data sets over there in the internet sites like uh.com machine hack.com and there are various uh more websites uh you can google it right and my government got in so yes you can go over there and you can download it and compete for the uh some some competitions you can also go for haircut there are many competitions organized over there and you want to be competing with the people so yes if you know if you know uh such amount of knowledge in machine learning after running such kind of things you can you can go for competition and you can learn many things and after each and every competition you should always go and visit the notebooks of other people so that you can learn that what they have implemented and what i have implemented and you can compare yourself with with their notebook as well so likewise you are learning and you are learning that what are the new things that the people have implemented and what what you have missed on it so you can also use their analogies and you can implement on your dataset like likewise how you learn so only i don't want to i don't want you to uh compete for like uh five to six competition at a time i just want you to uh just compete like two to two to three times that's it and you can uh just get uh after after completing just three to four company three maximum two three competition get to know what is happening and what are the things you required to gain more knowledge in terms of machine learning so after after getting such informations you you will start learning more in terms of uh explaining you start learning more about the machine learning and concepts so uh you should always participate in a competition after after you come after you complete your post so that you will get to know that where you're standing right now with uh uh with the people in the world so yeah after after competing and after getting enough of knowledge and investing one more after an investment one more month in the competitions and all then you can start uh going for the deep learning part so for deep learning i i would always suggest you to go for uh for krishnak playlist first as an initial part you should always start with the krishna playlist because uh i won't recommend android g as a first uh first course to start with as a deep learning because uh the things are like he's he's done his phd and he's a psja man right so understanding to understand his mathematics it will be very difficult so to just get to know what he's talking it would be very difficult for you to understand at the first time because deep learning is complex it's not that easy that anyone can just uh escape the machine learning and start directly with the deep learning it can't be done so you have to always uh find a resource which is very very easy to learn at the first so that it can give you a start then you can move on with a complex explanation so that you can understand more in depth so i would recommend krishna as a first recommendation for the deep learning you can finish it in within one week like 30 videos or 40 videos are there you can complete it everything within one week then after getting such informations the basic information about the uh functioning of deep learning you can always go for entrance courses uh it is always there in deep learning dot ai so all the entrenched courses you can find it on the site deep learning dot ai i will i will even write it really yes so you can go over there and you can always prefer uh content from these sites so and this is the best resource i always find and i always run from this uh this site as well so yeah for for deep learning it will take time like even even now and also i am learning planning itself so i've started in january and still i'm learning so because that day by day then many many things are happening so you have to be in uh updated way so you have to learn the new technology as well what is coming right now so yes so the the first thing for deep learning krishna is you will compete within one one week then after that you have to go for deep learning dot ai and over there android g course is present for uh uh deep learning yes so you can focus over there then after that you should always and yeah uh when you're learning deep learning uh don't be uh like haphazard like you shouldn't be very very terrified like what is happening right now i don't know what is this and shouldn't be uh facing such such uh you must you will face those kind of things but don't worry uh you can you can you can work on it and the for further for the preparation and the implementation of deep learning uh you can uh you can prefer whatever the uh krishnak playlist um samples has imported the great data set small data sets here he is he has been working so you can prefer such small data set and you can get a start in deep learning with that so you will get a knowledge by learning some uh implementation some some details from this video and you can implement implement also so you will you'll get a start then after that you can uh go for enter energy courses and you can learn um depth in depth concept concept because there are four courses in each in enter energy courses and each four course uh has almost approx 30 to 40 videos so it will take time to complete such kind of extensive course like i took it around one month to complete but it depends upon your efficiency that how much you are going to invest your time and with and with that investment of time you should be very very efficient in learning as well because uh because there are many concepts in deep learning and deep learning is not that easy i would say but yeah there are many concepts in deep learning you have to think many things in various perspective so it will take time to adjust also in in that terms of technology so you should always uh prepare in such a manner that like in in in how many months i can complete so i was learning deep learning so like i was giving eight hours a per day so like how i did it and like how how i did uh to learn your data science to learn the deep learning so uh this is how i did to laundry planning in one month yes so and then after that i started implementation after learning so many things from andrew and jay krishna i can all now i started learning the started applying the uh implementation of deep learning in in various data sets so for applying deep learning uh i founded a 100 various data sets from the kaggle.com and from uh from machine frame from machinehead.com so for for applying a n and such kind of things for cnn and other concepts i i used for cnn means image kind of data for applying cnn image kind of data so i have used the kaggle.com to prepare my uh to to see my implementation part of deep learning and for uh structured data i have used the machine hack.com data set so there i have applied a n part then after that uh for rnn and everything you're gonna be finding this rna and everything the whole deep learning course in and range equals so you don't have to worry about such kind of things you can find it over youtube asset so if you type uh you can also find in youtube you can search on youtube deep learning dot ai uh you can find it over there and you can get the those courses free uh of uh from from android for deep learning courses you can mark it over there you can bookmark those courses on your youtube so yes uh so these things are available on youtube and you just you just have to search it over there and the next thing is uh after this uh you should start learning and the deep learning is uh so for rna also the course is available uh in deep learning dot ei so after this uh learning these are the basics these are nothing but these are the basics so it will help you to build the concepts and and it will help you to uh build the concepts in terms of learning the new technologies so whatever things are coming these days it is based on uh those technologies which you are learning right which you will learn in deep learning courses so you should prepare in such a manner that those concepts the machine learning concept and dependent course which you have learned in these span of time you should be it should be in your mind it that shouldn't go off easily so you should be always keep revising those things now uh the next part is to implement such kind of things in in in the scenario so the for the data sets i have told you the kaggle is the best uh for resources uh to practice and deep learning and machine learning so you can find variety of the resources and what i did uh like in during this lockdown period uh i started applying an internship to get more data sets because i was a bit like bored of kaggle.com so i started uh taking started giving my internships application to the companies so that i can get the data from those companies and i can work on the data so that that will data will be a industrial data so i started working on those data as well and i started applying for the internships and many kind of many companies and from there i started gathering the data and started working and implementing these these uh these concepts what i've learned so this is how i learned and this is how i wanted to move in such uh field and this is what i did so this is how i learned and implemented many kind of complex uh problems as well so yes this is what uh a planning procedure you should be working and i think if you are multitasking then you should always use that uh that whatever the things you have in your in your in your mind you should always work with that thing also so yes uh you should always use multitasking capacity if you have you can do it or always so this is what uh i did and i think uh this this this part was not that easy uh to learn because these things because i am saying that it is not easy that means i have gone through it so i know and because basically because i have i'm not in this computer science branch so i know what are the difficulties uh i have faced and how i managed to learn such kind of things it was very very difficult because at that time no one was there to help me and to provide such kind of resources so i know uh now these days that we which are the general resources to prefer to to learn data science in a very in a very efficient way and in a free yes so you can do uh you can learn in such a manner and you can uh you can you can do just anything like in this uh seven to eight months it will possibly take you seven to eight months depends upon your efficiency as well like how how much you're learning how much you're trying to learn so if you're working it it would take time like it could be like one year for you to learn if you are just a student in b-tech or just pass out from uh institute so you can learn within uh within like seven to eight months uh these all things but you have to dedicate it you you can't uh you can't ignore such kind of things because these days unemployment is increasing and you should be focused on such things so you should always think such kind of things as well so yeah this is all about uh uh how to how to go in a flow and how to study and i have mentioned some of the resources so you can go and prefer such resources and you can learn on your own and so i will take a few questions right uh there are many questions i i guess uh you have you have written over here in the chat let me take one by one okay apart from pgp is asking apart from i will start from the first you can you can you can keep writing your questions i can just uh read it from here and i will take the linkedin question as well uh so after this so there are variety of many questions over there so apart from this pgp courses please let us let us know the strategy for learning okay i have explained the strategy for learning data science yes uh and how much time you have to get dedicated yeah i have told that also so how did you get in an interview call i finished my predictors in month of march but i can't see any possibility of getting a call so yeah uh for getting a call it depends on your resume as well so how you are representing yourself over there so you should always uh include uh you should always make a resume in in a very simple manner it shouldn't be any complex like if you are hr even if you are hr you will see your resume and in one shot you will get to know this person has such kind of skill and it should be short shortlisted so such such a resume should be prepared in such a manner that uh you can just uh you can just see and you can just uh shortlist that candidate and obviously uh the the skill part is always should be well defined like what you have done and what you can do so in such a manner the skill part should be well defined and and and the projects you are doing it shouldn't be that easy like it should be outstanding projects you can't just do a classification task like you can just apply a resonant or any kind of classification task or you can you cannot just apply hd boost or any kind of linear indication in it it should be very simple it should be very simple i just want to say you shouldn't just um it should be from the scratch deployment like uh you're applying the machine learning model all the techniques of data science then you're um making it live so that that model can be used by any any of them so you can deploy it on crowd on heroku cloud or any kind of other aws cloud or google platform so you can use such kind of things and you can make a model live as well so that many of the people can use it so this is what i want to say and this is how you wanna implement in your uh life cycle of data central life cycle of data science so now after doing such things and you should write these things in your resume uh while while writing a resume right so in the in the project section you should always mention that i have done this project such a small description of the project and then what what algorithms you have applied and with just a small line like into three to four line you have to conclude uh predict what you have what you have done now after uh writing such kind of resume you have to mention that you have also used a technology or like flask or any kind of library to deploy it over the cloud cloud or any kind of platform which you which you prefer so you have to learn in a such manner you have to apply it and you have to showcase you know resume as well so you have to prepare resume in such a manner so that you can be preferred and they will come to that okay you know each and every frame or even each and every a life cycle of a data science each and every part of a data science so like like this if you if you prepare resume you're you're done like the the your part is done like your resume is well prepared and you can showcase your skills uh in the part from the resume and your part is done no rest of the things it depends upon them so uh if you get a call it is very better and if you start after after getting such an extensive knowledge you can also write a blog and you can mention it over resume you will get a video over that also so that there's such a small small things you can highlight your resume and make your chance of picking your resume is getting will get better so like so i think that's um that answers your questions right a little bit and so yeah raj rajan is asking i can't please give give me a road map to anime can anyone uh regarding this uh road map to ai and data science okay i have written the youtube channel as well name update please put all the resources in description so at last okay sure i will put all the resources in the description of this video andrew and channels gandhi uh could you please tell me how long working promotion should be spent all the daily on a daily basis so yeah if you're working then i think uh this is you're working from home right so maybe you should spend at least two hours per day in a week like from in in working days i'm talking about like in five days if a working like so you should spend like two hours per day then in the weekend you should always invest like eight to ten hours in in saturday sunday like i said on saturday sunday you should invest eight to ten hours so that you can you can cover the pace that what target you have said so you have to cover that pace you have to maintain such kind of intense uh intense time and schedule for yourselves otherwise it would be very prominent problematic and the people are learning in a very fast manner and you could also get uh like you will be you will be out of competition then so people are learning very fast these days so you should be in a competition and you should learn in such a manner in a best and efficient manner okay yeah so can you tell me okay uh does this tools are necessary for knowledge insufficient is sufficient just tools which tools you're talking about i don't know i don't know okay uh crucial are you an idiot no i am not an iit and i'm just from a regular college uh normal college uh priya is talking about deep learning architecture and deployment are necessary for interview or there are some companies who can and hire on the base of ml so there are many companies who are working right now who are working in ml field only people are companies are taking transition into data like in deep learning so i'm just in a simple man i will just tell you that uh what is machine learning and what is depending and how they are preferring so uh since uh in 2013 or 14 or 15 in this this period the data was wasn't that enough since the jio wasn't there so that in that period the data wasn't there and like the data wasn't getting produced in such a huge manner so people the company were only preferring machine learning technologies at that time deep learning was growing so people were not preferring preparing such kind of technologies at that time in a deep uh deep learning and deep learning such as such kind of things so the companies were preferring only machine learning and the work was done by the excel only excel msxl so yes uh at that time the scenario was different and today's different so today we have uh internet connections and everything so data is getting produced daily in a very in a very huge manner so yes if you have huge data then you have to prefer deep learning yes you cannot use machine learning for huge data because at that time the accuracy will become very low and you are not getting it better output from the model so you have to prefer deep dummy in such cases if you have used data so these days the companies are getting used data so that's why the requirement is getting shifted to the deep learning part so and so the company is demanding machine learning as well at deep learning so in some some like in few years the this segment of machine learning will be like uh mandatory like it it will be like known that if the the person is knowing machine learning then only he is coming to deep so he he must be the the company must be like uh machine learning is just a part but there they won't be using it in future i guess maybe there's a scenario because the data is getting huge these bad days these the digital values so deep learning is becoming popular and you should also focus on such technologies as well because uh machine learning uh soon the people won't be won't be preparing yes so i i think that that's answer your question right uh and i think the architecture and everything for architecture and everything if you go through a deep learning part like cnn or any kind of uh ironing architectures you should always learn the mathematics parts as well i i have always said that you should always run the mathematic part then only you can move because those things are very complicated and you should know the mathematics then only you can understand the things and the next thing is uh the architecture the everything whatever the things are there in deep learning with the deployment the the same thing i have talked about the machine learning you should always start from the scratch to the deployment so same thing with the deep learning as well so in a deep learning projects you should always start from the scratch to the deployment so whatever you are doing you should always uh do in a manner like end to end you should always prepare things so so yes uh in interview if you if you are going in such a prepared manner that you know each and every phrase over data science and in deep learning if you know till the deployment part the the the the viewing perspective of an interval will be different different from inside and if you are able to explain such kind of things yes uh they're gonna select you for sure and they're gonna pay you higher also so yes this is all about uh deep learning and architecture the priest has asked and next thing is a nickel t can be depend on krishna and on for everything yes you can prefer krishna i'm not uh saying about against again i'm not against his channel because i am also learning from him so yeah you can prefer for everything uh so if you're doing a course if you're into any course of like into any postgraduate diploma course or pgp course yeah you can you have always online resources right so you can work with that courses also like you can learn with that courses also so what i did i i was going through that course also and i was uh preferring online resources also so you can do both of things at the same time there's no problem in that if you're not able to send such a course what you're preferring not there then you can go and search on google and start learning from there there's no uh demand ultimately you're doing it for yourself so you you went over there to learn and you have to learn anyways like how you're preparing it doesn't matter that you're you're learning from online or offline so you have to learn so danger is asking has the mathematic part of ml has been covered yes everything has been covered in the entry energy courses mathematics is mathematics behind this algorithm can be learned from same results right yes mathematics it can be learned from a statistics like khan academy and uh what this was yeah khan academy and andrew ng is explaining about the mathematics behind each and every every machine algorithms yes and the next thing is where i missed that part okay veena is asking i always fear about the what if i transit over something and got to know that this skills what i have gathered are very common now you have been in upsc preparation yes uh there's a problem like when i was preparing in upsc i even i had that thought like what i have prepared uh it would be very difficult to move with such uh technology which i which i am not aware about it but uh things were like this was my plan b so i had to do it and there was no other options and because of unemployment and everything the scenario was changing so yes i had to i have to take such kind of decisions and because my brother is also working in data science as a data scientist senior data scientist in sweden so he held me in in that that perspective and then after that i joined a course so i get got started from there and yes uh i learned many other things since then so yeah that that happened so when is again asking how you worked on competition process and then letting something go to grab something else and started from sky did you didn't you feel that you haven't got lost in the race yes there was a demotivation point when i gave upsc and i didn't i wasn't got selected in that so that's that's how you should always i think plan in a manner like if these things are not going well then you should always have a plan of plan b or c so this is what i did and i had gone through such phases and i know how to uh get those things working and you should always have a plan to uh if in the worst conditions so what i did so this these paths are like motivational speeches so you can take it in such a manner yeah so please mention this website name yeah i have mentioned the website name i will mention it in the description as well how much time it takes to learn deep learning it will take i've mentioned it so how many machine learning algorithms should be learned can you mention so there are like 10 machine learning 10 to 15 machine learning algorithms you you're going to get covered in entrance courses and even location access has covered it so you can go and watch it and at 10 to 15 questions are in 10 to 15 algorithms right now is enough yeah is it good to learn machine learning with decent knowledge of ml and deep learning no uh i won't suggest to suggest you to go with the parallel like you can't learn machine learning and deep learning parallel machine learning has a different concept and deep learning is just an external part of ml so you should always first learn the basics so basics are being covered in the ml then only you can understand the deep learning part yes sir how sir how you have prepared for interviews have you given any mock interviews uh i haven't given any kind of mock interviews but yeah i have been into many interviews and with that perspective i have prepared myself and i have been seeing jd's job descriptions everywhere on the linkedin so yes after seeing those job descriptions i have prepared according to that and i have seen such kind of job descriptions where the technologies what kind of technologies are required so with those technologies and i was learning yes how well should we learn python and and on what platform did you practice i practiced on uh data quest at the time the data cast was uh was cheap right so i was learning from there and i always prefer our resources where the uh the where we can learn and as well we can implement as well like side by side we can implement so in data quest it was like uh you you are reading in on the left hand side and you are you're implementing the same thing on the right hand side so that's what that's how i learn any channel for big data yeah big data is being is i don't know about the big data but uh you can you can get it on youtube uh there are many resources on apache spark you can work on it there are many sources on hadoop i'm not sure about i'm not sure about it uh because i've learned uh big data from my institute so uh i i am preferring that resources so yeah i haven't i haven't seen any kind of best user for the big data you can always go for uh coursera uh i have seen one uh resource uh in encore coursera for big data that they are providing specialization i don't remember i don't remember the uh institute name but you can prefer over there for the big data yes channels for sk sql and dbms for so much channels for sql so uh for sql i will i will suggest you to go for core setup coursera there is a course called sql for data science you can always prefer that and you can learn sql from there so rpg is asking sir is it necessary to learn transfer learning algorithm intuition yes it is very very usual and it is very very uh necessary to learn transfer learning because these days transfer learning is applied everywhere so you should be uh learning such kind of things and even i have been asking kind of questions in my interviews why not so you should be learning such kind of thing and the interview level will go high as you know much other things and that's how your increasing chance of getting uh selected in your interviews is it learned is it required to learn sql 2 yes sql is must for every data scientist and you should always finding a actually in data science you there's a phase called data uh extraction so for data abstractions you must be getting a data from databases or any hadoop servers so you should always be uh extracting such kind of things from different different resources so sql is a part of it so you should you should be using sql language to extract data from such resources so you should be knowing such kind of technologies as well such kind of language as well you haven't discussed about ai what is the scope of ai model in an ai is very different perspective like uh ai is just a ml and deep learning other part of ai so ai is very different thing so you shouldn't be worried about such things right now we should i think you should focus on ml and dl first then you can excel in ai because ai is everything is it's a different perspective we are talking about it's just making the human thing so you are artificially giving an intelligence to a machine so you can get the word what are the things required by what what things we do the same thing can be done by the machine so this uh this is a very different thing so yeah uh yeah is very different part of the thing right now we can we could talk at some some other time how to stay motivated for a desert data sense and don't don't give up you should always keep watching uh uh interviews i guess you should always watch interviews and many many good interviews you should watch and always keep watching good movies in terms of ai and where the ai is getting implemented yes sir is it necessary to transfer learning yeah i've covered this such as some resources for probability so probability and linear algebra is being covered in khan academy so you can prefer that khan academy course is full like you can get it it is covering more things so you can do anything or you can learn anything from khan academy which one is the best better computer vision or nlp i i mean according to job perspective so these days uh computer vision and lb are both trending so uh both are equally uh i i guess they're equally working good and they're equally equally equivalent so uh you should always focus on those those two terms because in company you never know what kind of product you you you want to get so it may be on computer vision or it may be on nlp so you should be thorough with all such kind of uh technologies yes so the next is uh bhaskar kumar das pasuku which one is the better computer okay i have answered this uh she should ask i have eight point sorry i have eight point five years of experience in auto fmg industry in integrative and uh preventive maintenance with one point five year in 4.0 industry i am learning here's which message should i target for okay you you're talking okay you're pretty maintenance so you can you can target uh automobile industry as well uh finance industry i think uh financial industry would work for you good for you and uh you can you can commit ai field also like computer vision industry uh nlp industry so these are the part of uh deep learning but uh the people are working in the companies are working in only some part of the deep learning also like in computer vision is some companies working nlp some companies are working so you can get into such a kind of technology as well so data science is just an interdisciplinary branch you can apply in any of the industries you can apply in civil engineering also so these technologies are never gonna be fair in the future so you can go a finance company or any of the uh the technologies i have mentioned so you can you can find it it doesn't matter which from which company you're coming from like which which part of your past was there so there's some resources for probability i've shared it and kind of is the best for the statistics yes it is it is uh good to start with mndl if you're in fourth you're in a tech because the future is ai so you should always learn and in within five to ten years uh you're gonna get uh very you're gonna you're gonna be seeing very huge changes in in terms of ai so everything is turning into an automatic automatic things and digitization is happening and you can also see uh the variety of things happening as soon as 5g will enter in india uh the scenario will change so i think it's a better start to go with the learning deep learning and machine learning or any data science things from the fourth year so there's some resources for probability okay this deployment does it to get into a company uh deployment is not necessary but you should know such things because because um you don't know whether you're gonna be working with startup or any kind of uh companies which are already been using such kind of technology these parts deployment past uh parts are being faced by machining engineers or uh the devops teams so you should you as a data scientist you should be you should be working with such uh people also so you should be knowing uh such kind of things of deployment so that you can help those guys as well and if those uh people are not there in your company you should you should take part of those uh companies so so that you will work in their part as well so data scientist is just a data scientist you should be knowing such technology such things as well so deployment part is must i guess you should you should know everything so i think uh as a data scientist you should be knowing each and every part from the start to the end difference between data scientists and data analysts and data engineer oh i think these these terminologies are being covered in many of the videos uh if you want me to explain i think it's a waste of time right now but as i was just as a start i can give you that uh data analyst is just an a job where you you're gonna be exploring the data just exploring the data so you won't be applying any any kind of models and all so you you won't be given any task to uh deploy a model or a work with a model or predictive models so in data analysis so whatever you're gonna doing with uh explorer exploration of the data the same thing will perform by the data analysis data analyst and the data engineer works with the managing our data so whatever data is coming from uh some some resources so it will gather such kind of data and store some such some some uh some uh hadoop or any kind of uh rdma server so those management and everything will be taken by data engineer and as a data scientist you will be working with modeling predictive and every aspect of the life cycle so whatever things the ada everything eda exploited data analysis and the the everything what you what you want to do with the data so modeling predictive modeling and everything and deployment also you can work with data scientists so the data scientist has got edge over all these two uh um what do you say uh topic of this uh different different segments of the data science yeah so how did you choose the project you worked on uh i explained like i explained right uh i i i got uh i was applying in internships so i got products from there and i started collecting data and started working on those and started showing showcasing my uh work over there in the resume so this is all this is how you you can also do building hackathon is necessary or our github and medium articles is enough to get a job so you should always maintain uh github repo because whatever you are doing you should always showcase in your github so this is what these days companies uh seeing your github account as well as a linkedin account so by looking at these accounts they will get to know that whatever what what the things whatever things you have done you have showcased in your github link and they're gonna go and check it over there so likewise they're gonna check you that whether you're seeing uh whether what the work you have done and whether you're following or not so this is what they're gonna check from this sir is it necessary it is necessary yes it is necessary what we can expect in our channel in near future yeah so in our in this channel i'll be posting uh new technologies i won't be explaining any kind of sorry um i won't be explaining any concepts over here because the concepts have been explained everywhere in the youtube channel you can find better resources from from anywhere in the in the youtube but i will be implementing uh i will be showcasing uh many complex implementations of deep learning which are coming these days in the new in the new era so because everything whatever the whole thing which have been already already been discovered uh and has already been implemented and already been shown in the youtube youtube in other youtube channels so this in channel i will try to implement a new technology as well as the complex things which are gone which are going to be there in the in in this and in this turn 20 and 201 so the updates will be happening in my channel so yes uh have you heard about lazy programmer in you you me yes lizzy programmer yeah his course is very good and you give me yes elizabeth yeah i i even i have learned from him so it's a very good course he's offering his years not this day he's often from many past years so it is it is very good you can you can go and prefer the lazy program in youtube what was the fees for the pgdm courses so it's a it's a kind of a personal thing so i can't answer it away you can ping me and i will tell you or even even you can go to the sites and you can get to know how much i paid for the uh for the pgdm post if i start from today how much time it will take to learn emerald as a full time runner but yeah you can learn you can learn everything in just one year like everything you can learn in just one year even even even less than that also it depends on your pace it depends on your learning as well yeah hackathons are necessary to get job if you're if you're getting into any hackathons it is and if you're performing good over there it is it is good for you so if you if you have showcased your skill over there and if you are telling that person that i have uh i have competed in such such such competitions and you can see the rank and i have secured this kind of rank and this is how i work and is what i did so that that's gonna help you even so this is what you can do it over here so i think a live chats questions are over and uh let me take few of the questions from linden that i found it very good so i think i have covered most of the questions right so uh i've talked about the resume i have talked about the resources and i have talked about the the process the how you can go and i have talked about my channel as well so what i'm going to posting soon let me cover a few more questions i think it was very very good they were very very good questions let me find it first just just give me a two minutes time i think this session is not not boring right i think i am trying to help i just don't want to uh exaggerate exaggerate this this session by by speaking something different i just want to speak whatever i did and just want to explain what i'm what i'm doing right now yeah so so people are asking like uh whether we should go for pg dm courses or any kind of courses to do data science or we can learn it by ourselves so i have whatever i have told you is online courses you can always work like i would suggest you like if you're working then you should always go for online courses whatever resource i have told you and but if you are a classroom program like in a classroom like if you want any classroom programs or any kind of uh such kind of thing you can go for such institutes to uh to go and learn and that will give you a start and i'm not promising that they're gonna teach you from end to end but yes they're gonna give you a start and just a start and don't expect any kind of things from uh from uh like high things from those those insured because these days uh the education is just for earning for earning i think you all know so because i have been into many courses so i know so instead of going into any resource any uh institute you can learn well learn it by yourself and just for degree you know if you're like if you're coming from uh easy background or cs background you don't need such kind of degree you can go for online certifications as well and you can uh prepare data science yes so i i don't prefer uh you to go for uh any institute and go and waste your time for like one year you can do many things in those one years those one so how much should i learn python or should i cover a first question so where where from i should practice resources or project so you can i've told you the projects and also you can go and prefer machine hack.com or kaggle.com or uh my government so you can get those at hackerheart.com so you can go over there and practice uh get the new data sets and get on uh get your design practice over there uh should i uh how much should i learn python i i like a python developer or an intermediate developer so yeah i think uh the questions are like uh whether you should learn python in in a very intensive manner or in just a just like how much i should be learning a python so i think in data science it doesn't require to you to be a python developer it's a very different thing so for data science uh photoscience it's just a thing a tool to work on a data that's it you shouldn't be a very good programmer at it so you can learn data science and if you're a good programmer it's a benefit for you because you can you can do many things of in the in just a span of time so if you're learning python in such a manner also it is better for you and i think in for learning data science the python it should is like a tool to just uh implement uh whatever you're thinking uh you know with respect to data set so yes python is just a tool so i don't want you to become a programmer i just want to become your data scientist yes so programmer programmer is a different thing and data scientist is a different thing so for those kind of for this kind of jobs there are different different types of uh requirements there so you can you can you can just understand what i am i just want to say so where should i cover ml first so there are people asking like should i cover ml from christopher or inducer or both ml pen so that's what i told you right uh you can learn from android g and emma and krish krishnan so i think uh most of the questions were answered and i think you found it uh i think you just just reply with whatever you found it and i think it is what i can do from my side and i think it was a good session from my side and it was bit uh like sir can you tell me tell any platform to learn search for institution for transfer learning krishna sorry i have noticed so discussed institutions intuition for transfer learning okay for transfer learning i uh i would prefer you to go for uh and it is with your magazine magazine the site is there for transfer learning and machinemastery.com and toward data science or medium if you have uh in if you have some amount of money you can invest over there and learn from it but um they provide intensive knowledge about these things uh for the implementation of complex algorithms and if you're preferring deep learning uh deep learning dot ai course from enterong these things the transfer learning and everything will be covered over there as well so you can get a deep intentions over there as well so that's not a problem so i think uh this is a this was a session i wanted to do for you all and i think i think i i did it finally so yes this was my first live session and there was a big problem in the starting uh i think that there was an issue with international but no i think it's established and we did it before now so yes this is all about this uh session and i think we will keep uh we'll give we'll keep expecting this kind of live stream in future as well so i will inform you in linden and hopefully uh we'll make a telegram channel as well soon so yeah so we will do it and uh we'll make it for sure so there are many more questions coming right now in korea there are 142 videos to watch everybody yeah uh you can you can go you can go and walk watch such kind of videos and if you're prepar preferring such kind of videos in a systematic manner you can get everything learned in a single shot yeah so i think 142 videos are too much to learn python uh you can prefer it depends like how much you are learning it depends upon you so you can by learning only you can understand it you know such kind of thing so you can skip that part also so it doesn't matter so yeah and i think 142 videos are very small small uh very small video so you can complete those videos in like like two weeks or three weeks so it doesn't matter for you so yeah so this is all about this session i think we should end it right here uh with a good note like what we had a discussion i think i have discussed almost all part of the things which i haven't discussed discussed in my last video with christian excel so i think this is all about this live session and i think you will start learning soon and whatever resource i have told you you can you can go over there and learn very easily and i think that that that's what that is that was my motive and i think i i planned to do it and yes we all did it and thanks for joining me uh we'll we'll see you uh in in few few weeks hopefully because i even i am so working right now so i think i won't be getting time much time so yeah i will prepare with the with few more videos like i will be coming with more videos in my on my youtube channel so you can go over and watch such kind of videos as well and yes you can start learning from now yeah so i've given you the resources i've given you tricks and i have told you how to proceed in how to approach in a in a free way so yes you can do it and don't don't get demotivated you will you will learn and that's not and that's not a tough data science is not tough it's just about mathematics you can go and learn so yes uh thank you everyone for reaching uh for reaching me out and thank you for attending this session uh hopefully we'll meet in the next session as well okay thank you bye",
